Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this Project, we will be creating a series of multiple classes in order to create an online Learning Management System.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Classes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three classes uploaded. The Course class allows a user to create, edit, or delete a course from the teacher's end, and it handles running quizzes. The Course class also allows students to view graded quizzes or take a quiz.
The Quiz Class grades the quizzes that the student takes.
The QuizRunner class is the main runner class which ties all the programs and methods together.
